  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Waste Warrior by KindKode</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <div class="intro">
    Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what information Waste Warrior collects, why we collect it, and how you can control it. We've written it in plain language — no legalese.
  </div>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>The short version:</strong> Almost all your data stays on your device. We collect your name and email during signup, and we may collect anonymised, non-identifiable usage data to understand how the app is used. We never sell your data. Ever.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
  <p>Waste Warrior is developed by KindKode, an Australian app developer. If you have any privacy questions, you can reach us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#324553414657455340405b5d4053424272555f535b5e1c515d5f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f28593818697859380809b9d80938282b2959f939b9edc919d9f">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

  <h2>2. What Information We Collect</h2>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Information</th>
      <th>Why we collect it</th>
      <th>Where it's stored</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Your name</strong></td>
      <td>To personalise your experience</td>
      <td>On your device only</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Your email address</strong></td>
      <td>For subscription receipts, account deletion verification, and occasional important communications</td>
      <td>On your device; shared with payment processor only if you subscribe</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Food inventory data</strong></td>
      <td>Core app functionality — tracking your items, expiry dates, and consumption</td>
      <td>On your device only</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Camera access</strong></td>
      <td>To scan barcodes when you add items</td>
      <td>Camera is accessed in real-time only; no images are stored or transmitted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Anonymised usage data</strong> (may be collected)</td>
      <td>To understand how many people use the app, which features are popular, and how to improve the experience</td>
      <td>With a third-party analytics provider (e.g. Firebase). Never linked to your identity</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>3. What We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect your location.</li>
    <li>We do not access your contacts, photos, or files beyond what you explicitly provide.</li>
    <li>We do not build advertising profiles.</li>
    <li>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to any third party.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Anonymised Analytics</h2>
  <p>We may use analytics tools (such as Firebase by Google) to collect anonymised, aggregated data about how the app is used. This might include things like how many users are in Australia versus other countries, which screens are visited most, or how often certain features are used.</p>
  <p>This data cannot identify you personally. It is used solely to improve Waste Warrior and to understand the app's overall impact (for example, how much food waste is being tracked collectively).</p>

  <h2>5. How We Use Your Email</h2>
  <p>Your email address is used for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sending receipts if you subscribe to Waste Warrior Premium (processed via Apple App Store or Google Play).</li>
    <li>Verifying your identity if you request to delete your account.</li>
    <li>Sending important service communications (e.g. changes to these policies or the app).</li>
    <li>Sending in-app or email notifications related to your food inventory, such as expiry reminders (with your consent).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will not use your email for marketing without your explicit consent.</p>

  <h2>6. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>Payments for Waste Warrior Premium are processed entirely by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play). KindKode does not store or process your payment card details. Subscription billing and refunds are governed by Apple's and Google's respective policies.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>The vast majority of your data — your food inventory, consumption history, and personal settings — is stored locally on your device. It never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.</p>
  <p>Your email address is stored on your device. If you subscribe to Premium, your email may be shared with Apple or Google's payment systems as part of the subscription process.</p>
  <p>We take reasonable technical steps to protect any data we do handle, but no system is completely secure. We encourage you to keep your device software up to date.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Because almost all your data is stored locally on your device, you are in direct control of it. You can delete all your data at any time using the Delete Account option in Settings, or by uninstalling the app.</p>
  <p>The only personal information we hold is your email address. If you would like to update or delete your email address, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5f3436313b34303b3a3e2a1f38323e3633713c3032"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d8b3b1b6bcb3b7bcbdb9ad98bfb5b9b1b4f6bbb7b5">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> and we will respond promptly. Note that if you have an active Premium subscription, we are required to retain your email address for billing purposes until your subscription ends.</p>


  <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Waste Warrior is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or applicable law. When we do, we will update the date at the top of this page. For significant changes, we will notify you within the app. Your continued use of Waste Warrior after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
